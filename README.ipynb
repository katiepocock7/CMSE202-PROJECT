    "As a group we all contributed! Everyone attended the meetings we agreed on and took on individual tasks that aided in moving forward to our accomplish our goals. Coming to a conclusion with our project depended on a lot of individual work that we then worked off of together. Anita built the foundation of our CatTrap game very early on using pygame, matplotlib, and networkx. Once we had this foundation the rest of our group members worked towards creating a plan that uses reinforcement learning to create an algorithm focused on trapping our cat. Katie created the README file. Stella posted useful information about reinforcement learning. "
